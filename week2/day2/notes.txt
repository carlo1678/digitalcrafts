Dictionaries are also referred to as objects. Variables will stay constant. 
You define a class with a class, and give it whatever name you want it to have. You stop class with a colon. class needs to be indented underneath. 
A class lets you model out something and you can define specific things on it, where you can create other instances of that class and use them all over again. 
When you make a class, you will have access to a "constructor". When you make a class and you make an individual object with that class, you're making an "instance" of that object.
It's created with what is known as a function called a "constructor". When keys are the same in dictionaries, and we're creating multiple, you should start considering using a class.
Dot notation is way you refer to values that exist on an object. You can define functions inside of a class that will apply to any instance of that class. Functions defined inside of 
a class are called methods. 
Dot notation refers to us using the period (.) and referencing something that exists on the class. (aka the thing we attached self to in Joe's example.)

define global functions and variables first at the top of your program
define classes next and any unique methods inside of them
then define your while loop if you need the user to keep doing task until a certain condition is met (remember, your condition needs to be global, and needs to be reassigned inside
your while loop)
